the files here represent the Hero's position. so 07. UTG+1 means the hero is UTG+1 and UTG limped. 03. BTN means hero is BTN and someone beforehand limped. When vs limp we assume there is a single limper and we don't really care who the limper was.

The raise size should be to 6bb, or more generally 4bb + 2n, where n is the number of limpers, and for these charts we are assuming n=1.

Thematically, the vs limp range should be quite strong, somewhere between the RFI range and the vs RFI raising range against middle position, but closer to the 3bet range. In other words, we could treat a limp as if it were a raise and deal with it accordingly, but because generally the limping range is missing a lot of the strongest hands, we can play more aggressively.
