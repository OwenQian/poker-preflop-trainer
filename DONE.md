### Range Builder Dev Tool Implementation Plan
- [x] **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
  - [x] ‚úÖ Create basic RangeBuilder component structure and styling
  - [x] ‚úÖ Implement action selector panel (Always Raise, Mixed Frequency Raise, Always Call, Always Fold, etc.)
  - [x] ‚úÖ Add RangeBuilder to App.tsx with toggle button to access dev tool
  - [x] ‚úÖ Build interactive 13x13 poker hand matrix grid component
  - [x] ‚úÖ Add click handler to set hand actions based on selected tool

- [x] **Phase 3: Export & Visualization** ‚úÖ COMPLETE 
  - [x] ‚úÖ Build "View" popup modal to display range data structure
  - [x] ‚úÖ Implement "Copy to Clipboard" functionality for range export
  - [x] ‚úÖ Add JSON/TypeScript format output generation  
  - [x] ‚úÖ Create range summary statistics (total combos, percentage)
  
- [x] **Phase 2: Data Management** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
  - [x] ‚úÖ Create range state management system to track hand frequencies
  - [x] ‚úÖ Build hand name mapping utilities (AA, AKs, AKo, etc.)
  - [x] ‚úÖ Implement frequency input controls for mixed strategies
  - [x] ‚úÖ Add range validation and consistency checks (export validation)
  
- [ ] **Phase 4: Enhanced Features** (IN PROGRESS)
  - [x] ‚úÖ Add preset loading (import existing ranges for editing)
  - [x] ‚úÖ Implement undo/redo functionality
  - [x] ‚úÖ Enable deselection on repeated clicks (set to Always Fold) and implement click-and-drag multi-cell selection
  - [x] ‚úÖ Add "Not in Range" action support with visual distinction (darker gray for hands not in starting range)
  - [x] ‚úÖ Copy to clipboard and view range should correctly show hands that are 100% folds as opposed to not in range.
  - [x] ‚úÖ Factor in frequencies that hands are in the previous range. E.g., if a hand is RFI 50% then in the RFI vs 3bet range it's only there 50% of the time not 100% which should be reflected in the combo count. It should reflect in the total number of combos in the subrange, and if a 50% frequency hand is 50% raise, 50% call, then that should end up as 25% raise, 25% call when counting the number of combos in the subrange that raise and call respectively.

#### FSRS Integration Implementation Summary
**‚úÖ COMPLETED - FSRS Quiz Setup Integration**

The following FSRS (spaced repetition) features have been successfully implemented:

**New UI Features:**
- **Due Cards Display**: Shows count of cards ready for review (e.g., "5 cards due for review (of 50 total)") - **Only appears when Spaced Repetition mode is selected**
- **Days Ahead Selector**: Number input (0-365) with up/down controls to review cards due in future days - **Only appears when Spaced Repetition mode is selected**
- **Sampling Mode Selector**: Radio buttons for "Random" vs "Spaced Repetition" hand selection
- **Dynamic Updates**: Due count updates automatically when days ahead value changes

**Technical Implementation:**
- **FSRS Integration**: Created `src/utils/fsrs/quizIntegration.ts` with core FSRS functions
- **Smart Hand Sampling**: Modified `generateQuizQuestion()` to support FSRS-based weighted selection
- **Progress Tracking**: Enhanced hand progress system to track difficulty and due dates
- **State Persistence**: Added `samplingMode` and `daysAhead` to user settings with localStorage persistence

**Hand Selection Logic:**
- **Random Mode**: Original random selection (unchanged behavior)
- **Spaced Repetition Mode**: Intelligent weighting system:
  - Due cards: 5x priority weight
  - New cards: 3x priority weight  
  - Difficult cards (high difficulty/lapses): 2x priority weight
  - Regular review cards: 1x priority weight

**UI Location**: All new features appear in the quiz setup page above the "Start Quiz" button when a range is selected.

**Data Integration**: Full integration with existing state manager for export/import of FSRS progress data.

#### Recent Critical Fixes (Latest Updates)
**‚úÖ COMPLETED - Critical FSRS Improvements**

1. **Days Ahead Default**: Confirmed default value is 0 for spaced repetition mode
2. **Remaining Cards Display**: Added remaining cards count in quiz interface during spaced repetition sessions
3. **Missing Hand Treatment**: **CRITICAL FIX** - Spaced repetition now properly includes fold:100 hands
   - When `missingHandTreatment: 'fold'`, all 169 possible hands are included in FSRS sampling
   - Hands not explicitly in range data are treated as `{ raise: 0, call: 0, fold: 100 }`
   - This ensures players practice fold decisions on weak hands, not just action hands
   - **Most Important**: Ensures complete range coverage for optimal learning

#### UI and Tracking Improvements (Latest Updates)
**‚úÖ COMPLETED - Enhanced Remaining Cards UI & Tracking**

1. **Improved Due Cards Tracking**: Enhanced algorithm to properly track rescheduled cards
   - Fixed issue where hands weren't being removed from review sample correctly
   - Better separation of new, due, and scheduled cards
   - Real-time updates when cards get rescheduled after answers

2. **Hover Overlay for Remaining Cards**: Interactive visual grid showing remaining cards
   - **Hover over "Remaining: X"** to see detailed 13x13 hand matrix
   - **Color-coded visualization**: Red (overdue), Orange (due today), Green (new)
   - **Category breakdown**: Shows counts for overdue, due, and new cards
   - **Real-time updates**: Overlay updates immediately after cards are answered

3. **Enhanced User Feedback**: Better visual indicators and real-time updates
   - Dotted underline on "Remaining" text to indicate it's hoverable
   - Immediate count updates when cards are rescheduled
   - Clear visual distinction between different card states

- [x] **Fix FSRS Over-Scheduling and Stuck Cards Issue** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Cards getting reviewed 6-28 times per session and never leaving schedule
  - [x] **Phase 1: Fix FSRS Rating System** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Proper wrong=1, correct=3 rating system
  - [x] **Phase 2: Optimize FSRS Parameters** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Poker-specific parameters for 2-3 reviews per new card
  - [x] **Phase 3: Improve Strict Mode** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Partial credit based on percentage of correct actions selected
  - [x] **Phase 4: Fix Sampling/Visualization Consistency** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Centralized range resolution with debug logging
  - [x] **Phase 5: Add FSRS Monitoring** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Debug panel, stuck card detection, manual reset functionality
  - [x] **Phase 6: Enhanced Features** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Session limits, review intensity controls

#### FSRS Overhaul Implementation Summary
**‚úÖ COMPLETED - Major FSRS Algorithm Fixes**

**Problem Solved:** Cards were getting reviewed 6-28+ times per session without leaving the schedule, creating infinite loops and poor user experience.

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. **Binary rating system** (only 1 or 3) caused cards to get stuck in learning loops
2. **Aggressive default parameters** designed for general knowledge, not poker training
3. **Strict mode penalties** caused repeated failures and short intervals
4. **Sampling/visualization inconsistency** showed wrong cards as "due"
5. **No monitoring tools** to detect or fix stuck cards

**Solutions Implemented:**

**üéØ FSRS Algorithm Improvements:**
- **Poker-Optimized Parameters**: Custom weights designed for 2-3 reviews per new card
- **Smarter Intervals**: New cards graduate in 3 days, wrong answers get 2.4 hours
- **Partial Credit for Strict Mode**: Rating based on percentage of correct actions (60%+ = rating 2, 100% = rating 3)
- **Learning Graduation**: Cards need 2+ correct answers to leave learning state

**üîß Monitoring & Control Tools:**
- **FSRS Debug Panel**: Shows all card states, difficulties, intervals, and review counts
- **Stuck Card Detection**: Automatically identifies cards with >5 reviews or >3 lapses
- **Manual Reset Functionality**: Reset individual cards or all stuck cards
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Debug console output for sampling vs visualization consistency

**‚öôÔ∏è Enhanced User Experience:**
- **Session Limits**: Configurable limit (10-200) with break reminders 
- **Session Hand Tracking**: Visual indicators showing review counts in overlay
- **Centralized Range Resolution**: Consistent sampling and visualization logic
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate feedback when cards are rescheduled

**üìä Results Expected:**
- New cards: 2-3 reviews if answered correctly
- Wrong cards: 2-3 correct answers needed to graduate
- Maximum session protection against over-reviewing
- Clear visibility into algorithm behavior
- Manual control over problematic cards
- [x] **Build Range Builder Dev Tool** - Create interactive range creation and editing tool for developers
